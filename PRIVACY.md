# Privacy Policy for MarkdownResume

**Last Updated:** December 8, 2025

MarkdownResume is designed to prioritize your privacy. We believe your career history is personal data that should remain solely under your control.

**1. Data Collection**
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, usage statistics, or document contents to external servers. The application functions entirely offline. The app has outgoing connection entitlements only to be able to show images on your CV that are pointing to internet URL like in the examples.

**2. Local Storage**
All files, resumes, and assets created or managed by MarkdownResume are stored locally on your Mac in the file paths you select. We do not have access to these files.

**3. Third-Party Services**
MarkdownResume does not integrate with any third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.
