### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Where are my images stored?**
A: Images are linked from your local Mac folders. Use the "Assets..." button (Cmd+Shift+G) to grant the secure sandbox access to your image folders.

**Q: How do I install a custom theme?**
A: Go to **Settings > Style**, select "File" as the source, and browse for any standard CSS file on your Mac.

**Q: My PDF export looks different than the preview.**
A: Ensure you are using the `@job-section {}` block for your roles to prevent awkward page breaks.
